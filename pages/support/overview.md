## Packages issues

In case you encounter problems while using the xPacks, please consider the following:

* read the documentation pages
* check the [Known issues]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/known-issues/)
* check the [FAQ]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/faq/)
* check the **µOS++** sections in the [GNU ARM Eclipse forum]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/forum/) for similar problems
* check the GitHub Issues trackers the specific package (for example the [µOS++ tracker](https://github.com/micro-os-plus/micro-os-plus-iii/issues/))

If you still could not find a solution, if you have interesting use cases, if you have custom configurations, and generally if you have any experience that you want to share with others, please use the GNU ARM Eclipse [forum]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/forum/).

If you are convinced you identified a bug (if you have doubts, use the forum), or you have a pertinent suggestion how to enhance the µOS++, please use the GitHub Issues [tracker](https://github.com/micro-os-plus/micro-os-plus-iii/issues/).

Follow the recommendations in the GitHub Issues tracker [READ ME FIRST](https://github.com/micro-os-plus/micro-os-plus-iii/issues/1/) and add a new ticket.

## Web pages issues

If you discover problems in the content of these pages (typos, wrong phrasing, etc), or you have suggestions on how to improve them, you can use the [Web Issues](https://github.com/micro-os-plus/micro-os-plus.github.io/issues/) tracker.

> Note: the migration from MediaWiki to GitHub Pages involved quite significant changes to the web pages, including conversion to [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), which was done partly with scripts, partly manually; we are aware that it is very likely that lots of mistakes are still present in the pages; we would appreciate any help in fixing them.

## Use of private e-mail

Please, please, please: **do not use private e-mail for support**, since such messages will be replied with a link to this page. The reason for this rude behaviour is simply an attempt to efficiently use the time; since forum posts and GitHub Issues are archived, other people having similar problems might benefit from the answers.
