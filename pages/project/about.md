## The project

The **µOS++** project was registered on [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/micro-os-plus/) in April 2007, and initially ran on AVR8 processors, but later was rewritten from scratch with Cortex-M devices in mind.

For more details, please read the [Project history]({{ site.baseurl }}/micro-os-plus/iii/project-history/) page.

## Credits

Many thanks to:

  * Dan Maiorescu, for his invaluable support during the design, development and testing;
  * Lix Paulian, for pushing me to complete the implementation of the third edition, and for the invaluable feedback while using it.

## _Perfekt ist nicht gut genug_

Some time ago, while watching a TV documentary about Porsche, I heard this line and I liked it. If this is indeed one of Porsche mottos, then thank you Porsche for it (and for the beautiful designs). (English: _"Perfect is not good enough"_)

## This web site

The first project wiki was created in November 2010 using the SourceForge hosted apps, then it was moved to a separate MediaWiki, and in 2016 the wiki content was migrated to a static Jekyll site.
