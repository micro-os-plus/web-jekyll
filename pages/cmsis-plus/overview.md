## Overview

**CMSIS++** is a portable, vendor-independent hardware abstraction layer intended for embedded applications, but designed with special consideration for the industry standard ARM Cortex-M processor series.

The original ARM Keil name stands for **Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard**, and the CMSIS++ design inherits the good things from ARM CMSIS but goes one step further into the world of C++; it is not a C++ wrapper on top of ARM CMSIS, but **a completely new design in C++**, with several C APIs as wrappers on top of the native C++ APIs.

## Components

The CMSIS++ components are:

* **CMSIS++ Core** - C++ API and implementation for the Cortex-M processors core and peripherals;
* **CMSIS++ Startup** - portable C/C++ API and implementation for the processor startup code, replacing non-portable vendor assembly code;
* [**CMSIS++ RTOS APIs**]({{ site.baseurl }}/cmsis-plus/rtos/) - a collection of C++ and C APIs for Real-Time operating systems, based on a POSIX inspired C++ layer;
* **CMSIS++ ISO Standard Threads** - an implementation of the **C++ Standard ISO/IEC 14882:2011(E)** Thread library, on top of the CMSIS++ RTOS threads;
* **CMSIS++ Drivers** - defines generic peripheral driver interfaces for middleware making it reusable across supported devices
* **CMSIS++ POSIX I/O** - a compatibility layer bringing together access to terminal devices, files and sockets, via a unified and standard API;
* **CMSIS++ Diagnostics** - a C++/C API providing support for diagnostics and instrumentation.

## Portability

Although designed with both the 32-bits Cortex-M architectures and the `arm-none-eabi-gcc` compiler in mind, most CMSIS++ components are highly portable and can be compiled with any ISO C++ 11 compiler for other platforms too, for example the CMSIS++ RTOS can run on 64-bits Intel based POSIX desktops, greatly improving components testability.

## Motivation

CMSIS++ was created both as a proposal for a future CMSIS, and to overcome the limitations/problems of the current CMSIS design, among them the lack of proper C++ support.
