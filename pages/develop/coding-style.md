The following rules are mainly based on *MISRA C++:2008 Guidelines for the use of the C++ language in critical systems*, by Motor Industry Software Reliability Association with additions from *Joint Strike Fighter Air Vehicle C++ Coding Standards*, Lockheed Martin Corporation Doc. No. 2RDU00001 Rev D, dated June 2007, with some changes and clarifications.

## General Design

This coding standards document is intended to help programmers develop code that conforms to safety-critical software principles, i.e., code that does not contain defects that could lead to catastrophic failures resulting in significant harm to individuals and/or equipment. In general, the code produced should exhibit the following important qualities:

- **Reliability**: Executable code should consistently fulfill all requirements in a predictable manner.
- **Portability**: Source code should be portable (i.e. not compiler or linker dependent).
- **Maintainability**: Source code should be written in a manner that is consistent, readable, simple in design, and easy to debug.
- **Testability**: Source code should be written to facilitate testability. Minimizing the following characteristics for each software module will facilitate a more testable and maintainable module:
    1. code size
    2. complexity
    3. static path count (number of paths through a piece of code)
- **Reusability**: The design of reusable components is encouraged. Component reuse can eliminate redundant development and test activities (i.e. reduce costs).
- **Extensibility**: Requirements are expected to evolve over the life of a product. Thus, a system should be developed in an extensible manner (i.e. perturbations in requirements may be managed through local extensions rather than wholesale modifications).
- **Readability**: Source code should be written in a manner that is easy to read, understand and comprehend.

### Coupling & Cohesion

Source code should be developed as a set of modules as loosely coupled as is reasonably feasible. Note that **generic programming** (which requires the use of templates) allows source code to be written with loose coupling and without runtime overhead.

### Rules

#### Should, Will, and Shall Rules

There are three types of rules: should, will, and shall rules. Each rule contains either a “should”, “will” or a “shall” in bold letters indicating its type.

- **Should** rules are advisory rules. They strongly suggest the recommended way of doing things.
- **Will** rules are intended to be mandatory requirements. It is expected that they will be followed, but they do not require verification. They are limited to non-safety-critical requirements that cannot be easily verified (e.g., naming conventions). Specific to JSF AV, MISRA C++ does not use them.
- **Shall** rules are mandatory requirements. They must be followed and they require verification (either automatic or manual).

#### Breaking Rules

- [JSF AV Rule 4] - To break a **"should"** rule, the following approval must be received by the developer:
    - approval from the software engineering lead (obtained by the unit approval in the developmental CM tool)
- [JSF AV Rule 5] - To break a **"will"** or a **"shall"** rule, the following approvals must be received by the developer:
    - approval from the software engineering lead (obtained by the unit approval in the developmental CM tool)
    - approval from the software product manager (obtained by the unit approval in the developmental CM tool)
- [JSF AV Rule 6] - Each deviation from a **"shall"** rule shall be documented in the file that contains the deviation). Deviations from this rule shall not be allowed, AV Rule 5 notwithstanding.

#### Exceptions to Rules

- [JSF AV Rule 7] - Approval **will not** be required for a deviation from a **"shall"** or **“will”** rule that complies with an exception specified by that rule.

## Basic concepts

### Declarations and definitions

- [MISRA C++ Rule 3–1–1, Required] - It **shall** be possible to include any *header file* in multiple translation units without violating the *One Definition Rule*.
- [MISRA C++ Rule 3–1–2, Required] - Functions **shall** not be declared at block scope.

    ILG: but at namespace level.

- [MISRA C++ Rule 3–1–3, Required] - When an array is declared, its size **shall** either be stated explicitly or defined implicitly by initialisation.

    ILG: no extern arrays without explicit size.

### One Definition Rule

- [MISRA C++ Rule 3–2–1, Required] - All declarations of an object or function **shall** have *compatible types*.
- [MISRA C++ Rule 3–2–2, Required] - The *One Definition Rule* **shall not** be violated.
- [MISRA C++ Rule 3–2–3, Required] - A type, object or function that is used in multiple translation units **shall** be declared in one and only one file.
- [MISRA C++ Rule 3–2–4, Required] - An identifier with external linkage **shall** have exactly one definition.

### Declarative regions and scope

- [MISRA C++ Rule 3–3–1, Required] - Objects or functions with external linkage **shall** be declared in a _header file_.

    ILG: to document that they are intended to be accessible from other translation units, otherwise isolate them as static.

- [MISRA C++ Rule 3–3–2, Required] - If a function has internal linkage then all re-declarations **shall** include the `static` storage class specifier.

### Name lookup

- [MISRA C++ Rule 3–4–1, Required] - An identifier declared to be an object or type **shall** be defined in a block that minimizes its visibility.

### Types

- [MISRA C++ Rule 3–9–1, Required] - The types used for an object, a function return type, or a function parameter **shall** be token-for-token identical in all declarations and re-declarations.
- [MISRA C++ Rule 3–9–2, Advisory] - `typedef`s that indicate size and signedness **should** be used in place of the basic numerical types.
- [ILG Note] - The ISO (POSIX) typedefs as shown below are recommended and are used for all basic numerical and character types in this document. For a 32-bit integer machine, these are as follows:

<!-- -->

    typedef          char   char_t;
    typedef signed   char   int8_t;
    typedef signed   short  int16_t;
    typedef signed   int    int32_t;
    typedef signed   long   int64_t;
    typedef unsigned char   uint8_t;
    typedef unsigned short  uint16_t;
    typedef unsigned int    uint32_t;
    typedef unsigned long   uint64_t;
    ￼typedef float           float32_t;
    typedef double          float64_t;
    typedef long     double float128_t;

- [JSV AV Rule 209 (MISRA C Rule 13, Revised)] - The basic types of `int`, `short`, `long`, `float` and `double` **shall not** be used, but specific-length equivalents should be `typedef`’d accordingly for each compiler, and these type names used in the code.

    **Exception**: Basic types are permitted in low-level routines to assist in the management of word alignment issues (e.g. memory allocators).

    MISRA C Rule was changed from should to shall.

- [MISRA C++ Rule 3–9–3, Required] - The underlying bit representations of floating-point values **shall not** be used.
- [JSF AV Rule 146 (MISRA C Rule 15)] - Floating point implementations **shall** comply with a defined floating point standard. The standard that will be used is the ANSI/IEEE Std 754 [1].
- [JSF AV Rule 147 (MISRA C Rule 16)] - The underlying bit representations of floating point numbers **shall not** be used in any way by the programmer.
- [JSF AV Rule 148] - Enumeration types **shall** be used instead of integer types (and constants) to select from a limited series of choices.

    Note: This rule is not intended to exclude character constants (e.g.‘A’,‘B’,‘C’,etc.) from use as case labels.

## Standard conversions

### Integral promotions

- [MISRA C++ Rule 4–5–1, Required] - Expressions with type *bool* **shall not** be used as operands to built-in operators other than the assignment operator `=`, the logical operators `&&`, `||`, `!`, the equality operators `==` and `!=`, the unary `&` operator, and the conditional operator.
- [MISRA C++ Rule 4–5–2, Required] - Expressions with type *enum* **shall not** be used as operands to built- in operators other than the subscript operator `[ ]`, the assignment operator `=`, the equality operators `==` and `!=`, the unary `&` operator, and the relational operators `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`.
- [MISRA C++ Rule 4–5–3, Required] - Expressions with type (plain) `char` and `wchar_t` **shall not** be used as operands to built-in operators other than the assignment operator `=`, the equality operators `==` and `!=`, and the unary `&` operator.

    **Exceptions**: Exceptionally, the following operators may be used if the associated restriction is observed:

    - The binary + operator may be used to add an integral value in the range 0 to 9 to ‘0’;
    - The binary – operator may be used to subtract character ‘0’;
    - The relational operators `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=` may be used to determine if a character (or wide character) represents a digit.

### Pointer conversions

- [MISRA C++ Rule 4–10–1, Required] - `NULL` **shall not** be used as an integer value.
- [MISRA C++ Rule 4–10–2, Required] - Literal zero (0) **shall not** be used as the *null-pointer-constant*.

    ILG: use `nullptr`.

## Expressions

### General

    MISRA C Rule 47 changed by replacing should with shall.

- [MISRA C++ Rule 5–0–3, Required] - A cvalue expression **shall not** be implicitly converted to a different *underlying type*.

    ILG: avoid expressions like `s32 = s8+s8;`.

    ILG: avoid `s8 = static_cast< int8_t >( u8 + u8 );`.

- [JSV AV Rule 180 (MISRA C Rule 43)] - Implicit conversions that may result in a loss of information **shall not** be used.

    Note: Templates can be used to resolve many type conversion issues. Also, any compiler flags that result in warnings for value-destroying conversions should be activated.

- [MISRA C++ Rule 5–0–10, Required] - If the bitwise operators `~` and `<<` are applied to an operand with an *underlying type* of `unsigned char` or `unsigned short`, the result **shall** be immediately cast to the *underlying type* of the operand.

- [MISRA C++ Rule 5–0–13, Required] - The *condition* of an *if-statement* and the *condition* of an *iteration-statement* **shall** have type `bool`.

    ILG: avoid `if (u8)`)

    **Exception**: A condition of the form type-specifier-seq declarator is not required to have type bool. This exception is introduced because alternative mechanisms for achieving the same effect are cumbersome and error-prone.

- [MISRA C++ Rule 5–0–14, Required] - The first operand of a *conditional-operator* **shall** have type `bool`.

    ILG: avoid `int32_a = int16_b ? int32_c : int32_d;`.

    - the same object,
    - the same function,
    - members of the same object, or
    - elements of the same array (including one past the end of the same array).

    Note that if either operand is null, then both shall be null. Also, “members of the same object” should not be construed to include base class subobjects (See also AV Rule 210).

- [MISRA C++ Rule 5–0–19, Required] - The declaration of objects **shall** contain no more than two levels of pointer indirection.

    ILG: do not use `int8_t *** s3;`.

- [JSV AV Rule 169] - Pointers to pointers **should** be avoided when possible.
- [JSV AV Rule 170 (MISRA C Rule 102, Revised)] - More than 2 levels of pointer indirection **shall not** be used.

    Note: This rule leaves no room for using more than 2 levels of pointer indirection. The word “shall” replaces the word “should” in MISRA C Rule 102.

- [MISRA C++ Rule 5–0–20, Required] - Non-constant operands to a binary bitwise operator **shall** have the same *underlying type*.

    ILG: avoid `value_16 ^= mask_8;`.

- [MISRA C++ Rule 5–0–21, Required] - Bitwise operators **shall** only be applied to operands of unsigned *underlying type*.

    ILG: Bitwise are not normally meaningful on signed integers.

- [JSF AV Rule 160 (MISRA C Rule 35, Modified)] - An assignment expression **shall** be used only as the expression in an expression statement.

    ILG: avoid `if (x=y)`.

- [JSF AV Rule 167 (MISRA C Rule 41)] - The implementation of integer division in the chosen compiler **shall** be determined, documented and taken into account.
- [JSV AV Rule 174 (MISRA C Rule 107)] - The null pointer **shall not** be de-referenced.
- ~~[JSV AV Rule 175] - A pointer **shall not** be compared to `NULL` or be assigned `NULL`; use plain 0 instead.~~
- [ILG AV Rule 175] - A pointer **shall not** be compared to `NULL` or be assigned `NULL`; use `nullptr` instead.
- [JSV AV Rule 176] - A typedef **will** be used to simplify program syntax when declaring function pointers.
- [JSV AV Rule 177] - User-defined conversion functions **should** be avoided. See Meyers [7], item 5.
- [JSV AV Rule 203 (MISRA C Rule 51, Revised)] - Evaluation of expressions **shall not** lead to overflow/underflow (unless required algorithmically and then should be heavily documented).
- [JSV AV Rule 212] - Underflow or overflow functioning **shall not** be depended on in any special way.
- [JSV AV Rule 204] - A single operation with side-effects **shall** only be used in the following contexts:
    1. by itself
    2. the right-hand side of an assignment
    3. a condition
    4. the only argument expression with a side-effect in a function call
    5. condition of a loop
    6. switch condition
    7. single part of a chained operation.
- ~~[JSV AV Rule 205] - The `volatile` keyword **shall not** be used unless directly interfacing with hardware.~~
- [ILG AV Rule 205] - The `volatile` keyword **shall not** be used unless directly interfacing with hardware or with multithreaded, or foreground/interrupt applications.
- [JSV AV Rule 214] - Assuming that non-local static objects, in separate translation units, are initialized in a special order **shall not** be done.

### Postfix expressions

- [MISRA C++ Rule 5–2–1, Required] - Each operand of a logical `&&` or `||` **shall** be a *postfix-expression*.

    ILG: The effect of this rule is to require that operands are appropriately parenthesized.

    **Exception** Where an expression consists of either a sequence of only logical `&&` or a sequence of only logical `||`, extra parentheses are not required.

- [MISRA C++ Rule 5–2–2, Required] - A pointer to a virtual base class **shall** only be cast to a pointer to a derived class by means of `dynamic_cast`.

    ILG: Casting from a virtual base to a derived class, using any means other than `dynamic_cast` has undefined behaviour.

- [JSV AV Rule 179] - A pointer to a virtual base class **shall not** be converted to a pointer to a derived class.
- [MISRA C++ Rule 5–2–3, Advisory] - Casts from a base class to a derived class **should not** be performed on polymorphic types.

    ILG: Explicit casts bypass this layer of abstraction resulting in higher levels of coupling and dependency.

- [JSV AV Rule 178] - Down casting (casting from base to derived class) **shall** only be allowed through one of the following mechanism:
    - Virtual functions that act like dynamic casts (most likely useful in relatively simple cases)
    - Use of the visitor (or similar) pattern (most likely useful in complicated cases)

    Note: Type fields **shall not** be used as they are too error prone.

    Note: Dynamic casts are not allowed at this point due to lack of tool support, but could be considered at some point in the future after appropriate investigation has been performed for SEAL1/2 software. Dynamic casts are fine for general purpose software.

- [MISRA C++ Rule 5–2–4, Required] - C-style casts (other than `void` casts) and functional notation casts (other than explicit constructor calls) **shall not** be used.

    **Exception** A C-style cast to void may be used to signify that the return value for a non-void function call is being ignored (see Rule 0–1–7).

- [JSV AV Rule 185] - C++ style casts (`const_cast`, `reinterpret_cast`, and `static_cast`) shall be used instead of the traditional C-style casts. See Stroustrup [2], 15.4 and Meyers [7], item 2.
- [MISRA C++ Rule 5–2–5, Required] - A cast **shall not** remove any const or `volatile` qualification from the type of a pointer or reference.
- [MISRA C++ Rule 5–2–6, Required] - A cast **shall not** convert a pointer to a function to any other pointer type, including a pointer to function type.
- [MISRA C++ Rule 5–2–7, Required] - An object with pointer type **shall not** be converted to an unrelated pointer type, either directly or indirectly.
- [MISRA C++ Rule 5–2–8, Required] - An object with integer type or pointer to `void` type **shall not** be converted to an object with pointer type.
- [MISRA C++ Rule 5–2–9, Advisory] - A cast **should not** convert a pointer type to an integral type.

    **Rationale**: The size of integer that is required when a pointer is converted to an integer is implementation-defined. Casting between a pointer and an integer type should be avoided where possible, but may be unavoidable when addressing memory mapped registers or other hardware specific features.

- [JSV AV Rule 182 (MISRA C Rule 45)] - Type casting from any type to or from pointers **shall not** be used.

    **Exception 1**: Casting from `void*` to `T*` is permissible. In this case, `static_cast` should be used, but only if it is known that the object really is a `T`. Furthermore, such code should only occur in low level memory management routines.

    **Exception 2**: Conversion of literals (i.e. hardware addresses) to pointers.

- [JSV AV Rule 181 (MISRA C Rule 44)] - Redundant explicit casts **will not** be used.
- [JSV AV Rule 183] - Every possible measure **should** be taken to avoid type casting.
- [MISRA C++ Rule 5–2–10, Advisory] - The increment (`++`) and decrement (`--`) operators **should not** be mixed with other operators in an expression.
- [MISRA C++ Rule 5–2–11, Required] - The comma operator, `&&` operator and the `||` operator **shall not** be overloaded.
- [JSF AV Rule 159] - Operators `||`, `&&`, and unary `&` **shall not** be overloaded. See Meyers [7], item 7.
- [MISRA C++ Rule 5–2–12, Required] - An identifier with array type passed as a function argument **shall not** decay to a pointer.

### Unary expressions

- [MISRA C++ Rule 5–3–1, Required] - Each operand of the `!` operator, the logical `&&` or the logical `||` operators **shall** have type `bool`.
- [MISRA C++ Rule 5–3–2, Required] - The unary minus operator **shall not** be applied to an expression whose *underlying type* is unsigned.
- [JSF AV Rule 165 (MISRA C Rule 39)] - The unary minus operator **shall not** be applied to an unsigned expression.
- [MISRA C++ Rule 5–3–3, Required] - The unary `&` operator **shall not** be overloaded.
- [MISRA C++ Rule 5–3–4, Required] - Evaluation of the operand to the `sizeof` operator **shall not** contain side effects.
- [JSF AV Rule 166 (MISRA C Rule 40)] - The sizeof operator **will not** be used on expressions that contain side effects.

### Shift operators

- [MISRA C++ Rule 5–8–1, Required] - The right hand operand of a shift operator **shall** lie between zero and one less than the width in bits of the *underlying type* of the left hand operand.
- [JSF AV Rule 164 (MISRA C Rule 38)] - The right hand operand of a shift operator **shall** lie between zero and one less than the width in bits of the left-hand operand (inclusive).
- [JSF AV Rule 164.1] - The left-hand operand of a right-shift operator **shall not** have a negative value.

### Logical AND operator

- [MISRA C++ Rule 5–14–1, Required] - The right hand operand of a logical `&&` or `||` operator **shall not** contain side effects.
- [JSF AV Rule 157 (MISRA C Rule 33)] - The right hand operand of a `&&` or `||` operator **shall not** contain side effects.

    ILG: avoid `if ( logical_expression && ++x)`.

- [JSF AV Rule 158 (MISRA C Rule 34)] - The operands of a logical `&&` or `||` **shall** be parenthesized if the operands contain binary operators.

    ILG: always use parenthesis.

### Assignment operators

- [MISRA C++ Rule 5–17–1, Required] - The semantic equivalence between a binary operator and its assignment operator form **shall** be preserved.
- [JSF AV Rule 81] - The assignment operator **shall** handle self-assignment correctly (see Stroustrup [2])
- [JSF AV Rule 82] - An assignment operator **shall** return a reference to `*this`.
- [JSF AV Rule 83] - An assignment operator **shall** assign all data members and bases that affect the class invariant (a data element representing a cache, for example, would not need to be copied).

### Comma operator

- [MISRA C++ Rule 5–18–1, Required] - The comma operator **shall not** be used.
- [JSF AV Rule 168 (MISRA C Rule 42, Revised)] - The comma operator **shall not** be used.

### Constant expressions

- [MISRA C++ Rule 5–19–1, Advisory] - Evaluation of constant unsigned integer expressions **should not** lead to wrap-around.
- [JSF AV Rule 149 (MISRA C Rule 19)] - Octal constants (other than zero) **shall not** be used.

    Note: Hexadecimal numbers and zero (which is also an octal constant) are allowed.

- [JSF AV Rule 150] - Hexadecimal constants **will** be represented using all uppercase letters.
- [JSF AV Rule 151] - Numeric values in code **will not** be used; symbolic values **will** be used instead.

    **Exception**: A class/structure constructor may initialize an array member with numeric values.

    Note: In many cases ‘0’ and ‘1’ are not magic numbers but are part of the fundamental logic of the code (e.g. ‘0’ often represents a NULL pointer). In such cases, ‘0’ and ‘1’ may be used.

- [JSF AV Rule 151.1] - A string literal **shall not** be modified.

    Note that strictly conforming compilers should catch violations, but many do not.

- [JSV AV Rule 198] - The initialization expression in a `for` loop **will** perform no actions other than to initialize the value of a single `for` loop parameter.

    Note that the initialization expression may invoke an accessor that returns an initial element in a sequence:

- [JSV AV Rule 200] - Null initialize or increment expressions in `for` loops **will not** be used; a `while` loop will be used instead.
- [JSV AV Rule 201 (MISRA C Rule 67, Revised)] - Numeric variables being used within a `for` loop for iteration counting **shall not** be modified in the body of the loop.

- [JSF AV Rule 153 (MISRA C Rule 110, Revised)] - Unions **shall not** be used.

### Bit-fields

- [MISRA C++ Rule 9–6–1, Document] - When the absolute positioning of bits representing a bit-field is required, then the behaviour and packing of bit-fields **shall** be documented.
- [MISRA C++ Rule 9–6–2, Required] - Bit-fields **shall** be either bool type or an explicitly `unsigned` or `signed` integral type.

- [MISRA C++ Rule 9–6–4, Required] - Named bit-fields with `signed` integer type **shall** have a length of more than one bit.
- [JSF AV Rule 154 (MISRA Rules 111 and 112, Revised)] - Bit-fields **shall** have explicitly unsigned integral or enumeration types only.

    Note: MISRA C Rule 112 no longer applies since it discusses a two-bit minimum-length requirement for bit-fields of signed types.

- [JSF AV Rule 155] - Bit-fields **will not** be used to pack data into a word for the sole purpose of saving space.

    Note: Bit-packing should be reserved for use in interfacing to hardware or conformance to communication protocols.

    **Warning**: Certain aspects of bit-field manipulation are implementation-defined.

- [JSF AV Rule 156 (MISRA C Rule 113)] - All the members of a structure (or class) **shall** be named and shall only be accessed via their names.

    **Exception**: An unnamed bit-field of width zero may be used to specify alignment of the next bit-field at an allocation boundary. [10], 9.6(2)

## Derived classes

### Multiple base classes

- [MISRA C++ Rule 10–1–1, Advisory] - Classes **should not** be derived from virtual bases.

- [MISRA C++ Rule 10–1–3, Required] - An accessible base class **shall not** be both virtual and non-virtual in the same hierarchy.

### Member name lookup

- [MISRA C++ Rule 10–2–1, Advisory] - All accessible entity names within a multiple inheritance hierarchy **should** be *unique*.

### Virtual functions

- [MISRA C++ Rule 10–3–1, Required] - There **shall** be no more than one definition of each virtual function on each path through the inheritance hierarchy.
- [MISRA C++ Rule 10–3–2, Required] - Each overriding virtual function **shall** be declared with the `virtual` keyword.
- [MISRA C++ Rule 10–3–3, Required] - A virtual function **shall** only be overridden by a *pure virtual function* if it is itself declared as *pure virtual*.
- [JSF AV Rule 97.1] - Neither operand of an equality operator (`==` or `!=`) **shall** be a pointer to a virtual member function.

## Member access control

### General

- [MISRA C++ Rule 11–0–1, Required] - Member data in non-*POD* class types **shall** be private.
- [JSF AV Rule 57] - The public, protected, and private sections of a class **will** be declared in that order (the public section is declared before the protected section which is declared before the private section).
- [JSF AV Rule 65] - A structure **should** be used to model an entity that does not require an invariant.
- [JSF AV Rule 66] - A class **should** be used to model an entity that maintains an invariant.
- [JSF AV Rule 67] - Public and protected data **should** only be used in structs - not classes.

    **Exception**: Protected members may be used in a class as long as that class does not participate in a client interface. See AV Rule 88.

## Special member functions

### Constructors

- [MISRA C++ Rule 12–1–1, Required] - An object’s dynamic type **shall not** be used from the body of its constructor or destructor.
- [MISRA C++ Rule 12–1–2, Advisory] - All constructors of a class **should** explicitly call a constructor for all of its immediate base classes and all virtual base classes.
- [MISRA C++ Rule 12–1–3, Required] - All constructors that are callable with a single argument of fundamental type **shall** be declared `explicit`.
- [JSF AV Rule 70.1] - An object **shall not** be improperly used before its lifetime begins or after its lifetime ends.
- [JSF AV Rule 71] - Calls to an externally visible operation of an object, other than its constructors, **shall not** be allowed until the object has been fully initialised.
- [JSF AV Rule 71.1] - A class’s virtual functions **shall not** be invoked from its destructor or any of its constructors.
- [JSF AV Rule 72] - The invariant for a class **should** be:
    - a part of the postcondition of every class constructor,
    - a part of the precondition of the class destructor (if any),
    - a part of the precondition and postcondition of every other publicly accessible operation.
- [JSF AV Rule 73] - Unnecessary default constructors shall not be defined. See Meyers [7], item 4. (See also AV Rule 143).
- [JSF AV Rule 74] - Initialization of nonstatic class members **will** be performed through the member initialisation list rather than through assignment in the body of a constructor. See Meyers [6], item 12.

    **Exception**: Assignment should be used when an initial value cannot be represented by a simple expression (e.g. initialization of array values), or when a name must be introduced before it can be initialized (e.g. value received via an input stream).

- [JSF AV Rule 75] - Members of the initialization list **shall** be listed in the order in which they are declared in the class. See Stroustrup [2], 10.4.5 and Meyers [6], item 13.

    Note: Since base class members are initialised before derived class members, base class initializers should appear at the beginning of the member initialization list.

- [JSF AV Rule 76] - A copy constructor and an assignment operator **shall** be declared for classes that contain pointers to data items or nontrivial destructors. See Meyers [6], item 11.

    Note: See also AV Rule 80 which indicates that default copy and assignment operators are preferable when those operators offer reasonable semantics.

- [JSF AV Rule 77] - A copy constructor **shall** copy all data members and bases that affect the class invariant (a data element representing a cache, for example, would not need to be copied).

    Note: If a reference counting mechanism is employed by a class, a literal copy need not be performed in every case. See also AV Rule 83.

- [JSF AV Rule 77.1] - The definition of a member function **shall not** contain default arguments that produce a signature identical to that of the implicitly-declared copy constructor for the corresponding class/structure.
- [JSF AV Rule 78] - All base classes with a virtual function **shall** define a virtual destructor.

    Note: This rule does not imply the use of dynamic memory (allocation/deallocation from the free store) will be used. See AV Rule 206.

- [JSF AV Rule 79] - All resources acquired by a class **shall** be released by the class’s destructor. See Stroustrup [2], 14.4 and Meyers [7], item 9.
- [JSF AV Rule 80] - The default copy and assignment operators **will** be used for classes when those operators offer reasonable semantics.

### Copying class objects

- [MISRA C++ Rule 12–8–1, Required] - A copy constructor **shall** only initialize its base classes and the non- static members of the class of which it is a member.
- [MISRA C++ Rule 12–8–2, Required] - The copy assignment operator **shall** be declared *protected* or *private* in an abstract class.

## Templates

The following guidelines provided by Stroustrup[2], 13.8, offer advice when to prefer the use of templates over the use of inheritance:

1. Prefer a template over derived classes when run-time efficiency is at a premium.
2. Prefer derived classes over a template if adding new variants without recompilation is important.
3. Prefer a template over derived classes when no common base can be defined.
4. Prefer a template over derived classes when built-in types and structures with compatibility constraints are important.

### Template declarations

    2. with respect to all functions instantiated by actual arguments.

    Note: The compiler should be configured to generate the list of actual template instantiations.

- [JSF AV Rule 102] - Template tests **shall** be created to cover all actual template instantiations.

    Note: The compiler should be configured to generate the list of actual template instantiations.

### Template instantiation and specialisation

- [MISRA C++ Rule 14–7–1, Required] - All class templates, function templates, class template member functions and class template static members **shall** be instantiated at least once.
- [MISRA C++ Rule 14–7–2, Required] - For any given template specialization, an explicit instantiation of the template with the *template-arguments* used in the specialization **shall not** render the program ill-formed.
- [MISRA C++ Rule 14–7–3, Required] - All partial and explicit specializations for a template **shall** be declared in the same file as the declaration of their *primary template*.
- [JSF AV Rule 104] - A template specialization **shall** be declared before its use. See Stroustrup [2], 13.5.

- [JSF AV Rule 106] - Specializations for pointer types **should** be made where appropriate. See Stroustrup [2], 13.5.

### Function template specialisation

- [MISRA C++ Rule 14–8–1, Required] - Overloaded function templates **shall not** be explicitly specialized.
- [MISRA C++ Rule 14–8–2, Advisory] - The viable *function set* for a function call **should** either contain no function specializations, or only contain function specialisations.

- [MISRA C++ Rule 15–3–2, Advisory] - There **should** be at least one exception handler to catch all otherwise unhandled exceptions.
- [MISRA C++ Rule 15–3–3, Required] - Handlers of a *function-try-block* implementation of a class constructor or destructor **shall not** reference non-static members from this class or its bases.

- [MISRA C++ Rule 15–3–5, Required] - A class type exception **shall** always be caught by reference.
- [MISRA C++ Rule 15–3–6, Required] - Where multiple handlers are provided in a single *try-catch* statement or *function-try-block* for a derived class and some or all of its bases, the handlers **shall** be ordered most-derived to base class.
- [MISRA C++ Rule 15–3–7, Required] - Where multiple handlers are provided in a single `try` - `catch` statement or *function-try-block*, any ellipsis (catch-all) handler **shall** occur last.

### Exception specifications

- [MISRA C++ Rule 15–4–1, Required] - If a function is declared with an exception-specification, then all declarations of the same function (in other translation units) **shall** be declared with the same set of type-ids.

### Special functions

- [MISRA C++ Rule 16–0–6, Required] - In the definition of a function-like macro, each instance of a parameter **shall** be enclosed in parentheses, unless it is used as the operand of `#` or `##`.
- [JSF AV Rule 29] - The `#define` pre-processor directive **shall not** be used to create inline macros. Inline functions **shall** be used instead.
- [JSF AV Rule 30] - The `#define` pre-processor directive **shall not** be used to define constant values. Instead, the `const` qualifier **shall** be applied to variable declarations to specify constant values.

    The only exception to this rule is for constants that are commonly defined by third-party modules. For example, `#define` is typically used to define `NULL` in standard header files. Consequently, `NULL` may be treated as a macro for compatibility with third-party tools.

- [MISRA C++ Rule 16–0–7, Required] - Undefined macro identifiers **shall not** be used in `#if` or `#elif` preprocessor directives, except as operands to the defined operator.
- [MISRA C++ Rule 16–0–8, Required] - If the `#` token appears as the first token on a line, then it **shall** be immediately followed by a preprocessing token.
- [JSF AV Rule 26] - Only the following pre-processor directives shall be used:
    1. `#ifndef`
    2. `#define`
    3. `#endif`
    4. `#include`
- [JSF AV Rule 27] - `#ifndef`, `#define` and `#endif` **will** be used to prevent multiple inclusions of the same header file. Other techniques to prevent the multiple inclusions of header files **will not** be used.
- [JSF AV Rule 28] - The `#ifndef` and `#endif` pre-processor directives will only be used as defined in AV Rule 27 to prevent multiple inclusions of the same header file.
- [JSF AV Rule 31] - The `#define` pre-processor directive **will** only be used as part of the technique to prevent multiple inclusions of the same header file.

### Conditional inclusion

- [MISRA C++ Rule 16–1–1, Required] - The `defined` preprocessor operator **shall** only be used in one of the two standard forms.

<!-- -->

     defined ( identifier )
     defined identifier

- [MISRA C++ Rule 16–1–2, Required] - All `#else`, `#elif` and `#endif` preprocessor directives **shall** reside in the same file as the `#if` or `#ifdef` directive to which they are related.

### Source file inclusion

- [MISRA C++ Rule 16–2–1, Required] - The pre-processor **shall** only be used for file inclusion and include guards.
- [MISRA C++ Rule 16–2–2, Required] - C++ macros **shall** only be used for include guards, type qualifiers, or storage class specifiers.
- [MISRA C++ Rule 16–2–3, Required] - Include guards **shall** be provided.
- [MISRA C++ Rule 16–2–4, Required] - The `'`, `"`, `/*` or `//` characters **shall not** occur in a header file name.

- [JSF AV Rule 32] - The `#include` pre-processor directive **will** only be used to include header (\*.h) files.

    **Exception**: I the case of template class or function definitions, the code may be partitioned into separate header and implementation files. In this case, the implementation file may be included as a part of the header file. The implementation file is logically a part of the header and is not separately compilable.

- [JSF AV Rule 33] - The `#include` directive **shall** use the <filename.h> notation to include header files.
- [JSF AV Rule 34] - Header files **should** contain logically related declarations only.
- [JSF AV Rule 35] - A header file **will** contain a mechanism that prevents multiple inclusions of itself.
- [JSF AV Rule 36] - Compilation dependencies **should** be minimized when possible. (Stroustrup [2], Meyers [6], item 34)
- [JSF AV Rule 37] - Header (include) files **should** include only those header files that are required for them to successfully compile. Files that are only used by the associated .cpp file should be placed in the .cpp file - not the .h file.
- [JSF AV Rule 38] - Declarations of classes that are only accessed via pointers (`*`) or references (`&`) **should** be supplied by forward headers that contain only forward declarations.
- [JSF AV Rule 39] - Header files (\*.h) **will not** contain non-const variable definitions or function definitions.

    **Exception**: Inline functions and template definitions may be included in header files.

- [JSF AV Rule 40] - Every implementation file **shall** include the header files that uniquely define the inline functions, types, and templates used.

### Macro replacement

- ~~[JSF AV Rule 20 (MISRA C Rule 122)] - The `setjmp` macro and the `longjmp` function **shall not** be used.~~ (duplicate)

## Language support library

### General

- [MISRA C++ Rule 18–0–3, Required] - The library functions `abort`, `exit`, `getenv` and `system` from library `<cstdlib>` **shall not** be used.
- [JSF AV Rule 24 (MISRA C Rule 126] - The library functions `abort`, `exit`, `getenv` and `system` from library `<stdlib.h>` **shall not** be used.
- [MISRA C++ Rule 18–0–4, Required] - The time handling functions of library `<ctime>` **shall not** be used.
- [JSF AV Rule 25 (MISRA C Rule 127] - The time handling functions of library `<time.h>` **shall not** be used.
- [MISRA C++ Rule 18–0–5, Required] - The unbounded functions of library `<cstring>` **shall not** be used.
- [JSF AV Rule 19 (MISRA C Rule 121)] - `<locale.h>` and the `setlocale` function **shall not** be used.
- [JSF AV Rule 16] - Only DO-178B level A [15] - certifiable or SEAL 1 C/C++ libraries shall be used with safety-critical (i.e. SEAL 1) code [13].

### Implementation properties

- [MISRA C++ Rule 18–2–1, Required] - The macro `offsetof` **shall not** be used.
- [JSF AV Rule 18 (MISRA C Rule 120)] - The macro `offsetof`, in library `<stddef.h>`, **shall not** be used.

### Dynamic memory management

- [MISRA C++ Rule 18–4–1, Required] - Dynamic heap memory allocation **shall not** be used.
- [JSV AV Rule 206 (MISRA C Rule 118, Revised)] - Allocation/deallocation from/to the free store (heap) **shall not** occur after initialization.

    Note that the “placement” `operator new()`, although not technically dynamic memory, may only be used in low-level memory management routines. See AV Rule 70.1 for object lifetime issues associated with placement `operator new()`.

- [JSV AV Rule 207] - Unencapsulated global data **will** be avoided.

    Note: If multiple clients require access to a single resource, that resource should be wrapped in a class that manages access to that resource. For example, semantic controls that prohibit unrestricted access may be provided (e.g. singletons and input streams). See AV_Rule_207_Appendix_A for examples.

### Other runtime support

- [MISRA C++ Rule 18–7–1, Required] - The signal handling facilities of `<csignal>` **shall not** be used.

- ~~[JSF AV Rule 17 (MISRA C Rule 119)] - The error indicator `errno` **shall not** be used.~~ (duplicate)

    **Exception**: If there is no other reasonable way to communicate an error condition to an application, then `errno` may be used. For example, third party math libraries will often make use of `errno` to inform an application of underflow/overflow or out-of-range/domain conditions. Even in this case, `errno` should only be used if its design and implementation are well-defined and documented.

## Input/output library

    **Exception**: A function containing a switch statement with many case labels may exceed this limit.

### Style

- [JSF AV Rule 41] - Source lines **will** be kept to a length of 120 characters or less.
- [ILG Rule, Advisory] - Source lines **should** be kept to a length of 80 characters or less.
- [JSF AV Rule 42] - Each expression-statement **will** be on a separate line.
- [JSF AV Rule 43] - Tabs **should** be avoided.
- [JSF AV Rule 44] - All indentations **will** be at least two spaces and be consistent within the same source file.
- [JSF AV Rule 59 (MISRA C Rule 59, Revised)] - The statements forming the body of an `if`, `else if`, `else`, `while`, `do...while` or for statement shall always be enclosed in braces, even if the braces form an empty block.
- ~~[JSF AV Rule 60] - Braces (`{}`) which enclose a block will be placed in the same column, on separate lines directly before and after the block.~~
- ~~[JSF AV Rule 61] - Braces (`{}`) which enclose a block will have nothing else on the line except comments (if necessary).~~
- [ILG Rule] - Indentation shall be consistent for all source files of a project.
- [ILG Rule, Advisory] - The indentation style **should** be the GNU Style, preferably as implemented by default, without changes, by the IDE used for development (for example Eclipse CDT)
- [JSF AV Rule 62] - The dereference operator `*` and the address-of operator `&` **will** be directly connected with the type-specifier.
- [JSF AV Rule 63] - Spaces **will not** be used around `.` or `->`, nor between unary operators and operands.
- [JSF AV Rule 152] - Multiple variable declarations shall not be allowed on the same line.
- [JSV AV Rule 216] - Programmers **should not** attempt to prematurely optimize code. See Meyers [7], item 16.

    Note: This rule does not preclude early consideration of fundamental algorithmic and data structure efficiencies.

    See also AV Rule 125 and AV Rule 177 for performance recommendations.

- [JSV AV Rule 218] - Compiler warning levels **will** be set in compliance with project policies.
- [ILG Rule, Advisory] - Compiler warning levels **should** be set to maximum.

### Naming Files

- [JSF AV Rule 53] - Header files **will** always have a file name extension of ".h".
- [JSF AV Rule 53.1] - The following character sequences **shall not** appear in header file names: `‘`, `\`, `/*`, `//`, or `"`.
- [JSF AV Rule 54] - Implementation files **will** always have a file name extension of `.cpp`.
- [JSF AV Rule 55] - The name of a header file **should** reflect the logical entity for which it provides declarations.
- [JSF AV Rule 56] - The name of an implementation file **should** reflect the logical entity for which it provides definitions and have a `.cpp` extension (this name will normally be identical to the header file that provides the corresponding declarations.)

    At times, more than one `.cpp` file for a given logical entity will be required. In these cases, a suffix should be appended to reflect a logical differentiation.

### Classes

- [JSF AV Rule 64] - A class interface **should** be complete and minimal. See Meyers [6], item 18.
- [JSF AV Rule 69] - A member function that does not affect the state of an object (its instance variables) **will** be declared *const*.

    Member functions should be `const` by default. Only when there is a clear, explicit reason should the `const` modifier on member functions be omitted.

- [JSF AV Rule 70] - A class **will** have friends only when a function or object requires access to the private elements of the class, but is unable to be a member of the class for logical or efficiency reasons.
- [JSF AV Rule 84] - Operator overloading **will** be used sparingly and in a conventional manner.
- [JSF AV Rule 85] - When two operators are opposites (such as `==` and `!=`), both **will** be defined and one **will** be defined in terms of the other.

### Inheritance

Class hierarchies are appropriate when run-time selection of implementation is required. If run-time resolution is not required, template parameterization should be considered (templates are better-behaved and faster than virtual functions). Finally, simple independent concepts should be expressed as concrete types. The method selected to express the solution should be commensurate with the complexity of the problem.

The following rules provide additional detail and guidance when considering the structure of inheritance hierarchies.

- [JSF AV Rule 86] - Concrete types **should** be used to represent simple independent concepts. See Stroustrup [2], 25.2.
- [JSF AV Rule 87] - Hierarchies **should** be based on abstract classes. See Stroustrup [2], 12.5.
- [JSF AV Rule 88] - Multiple inheritance **shall** only be allowed in the following restricted form: *n* interfaces plus *m* private implementations, plus at most one protected implementation.
- [JSF AV Rule 88.1] - A stateful virtual base **shall** be explicitly declared in each derived class that accesses it.
- [JSF AV Rule 89] - A base class **shall not** be both virtual and non-virtual in the same hierarchy.
- [JSF AV Rule 90] - Heavily used interfaces **should** be minimal, general and abstract. See Stroustrup [2] 23.4.
- [JSF AV Rule 91] - Public inheritance **will** be used to implement “is-a” relationships. See Meyers [6], item 35.
- [JSF AV Rule 92] - A subtype (publicly derived classes) **will** conform to the following guidelines with respect to all classes involved in the polymorphic assignment of different subclass instances to the same variable or parameter during the execution of the system:
    - Preconditions of derived methods must be at least as weak as the preconditions of the methods they override.
    - Postconditions of derived methods must be at least as strong as the postconditions of the methods they override.

    In other words, subclass methods must expect less and deliver more than the base class methods they override. This rule implies that subtypes will conform to the Liskov Substitution Principle.

- [JSF AV Rule 93] - “has-a” or “is-implemented-in-terms-of” relationships **will** be modeled through membership or non-public inheritance. See Meyers [6], item 40.
- [JSF AV Rule 94] - An inherited nonvirtual function **shall not** be redefined in a derived class. See Meyers [6], item 37.
- [JSF AV Rule 95] - An inherited default parameter **shall** never be redefined. See Meyers [6], item 38.
- [JSF AV Rule 96] - Arrays **shall not** be treated polymorphically. See Meyers [7], item 3.
- [JSF AV Rule 97] - Arrays **shall not** be used in interfaces. Instead, the *Array* class should be used.
- [JSV AV Rule 219] - All tests applied to a base class interface **shall** be applied to all derived class interfaces as well. If the derived class poses stronger postconditions/invariants, then the new postconditions /invariants shall be substituted in the derived class tests.

    Note: This rule will often imply that every test case appearing in the set of test cases associated with a class will also appear in the set of test cases associated with each of its derived classes.

- [JSV AV Rule 220] - Structural coverage algorithms **shall** be applied against *flattened* classes.

    Note: When a class is viewed with respect to all of its components (both defined at the derived level as well as inherited from all of its base levels) it is said to be *flattened*.

- [JSV AV Rule 221] - Structural coverage of a class within an inheritance hierarchy containing virtual functions **shall** include testing every possible resolution for each set of identical polymorphic references.

### Data Representation

- [JSV AV Rule 210] - Algorithms **shall not** make assumptions concerning how data is represented in memory (e.g. big endian vs. little endian, base class subobject ordering in derived classes, nonstatic data member ordering across access specifiers, etc.)

    **Exception**: Low level routines that are expressly written for the purpose of data formatting (e.g. marshalling data, endian conversions, etc.) are permitted.

- [JSV AV Rule 210.1] - Algorithms **shall not** make assumptions concerning the order of allocation of nonstatic data members separated by an access specifier. See also AV Rule 210 on data representation.
- [JSV AV Rule 211] - Algorithms shall not assume that `short`s, `int`s, `long`s, `float`s, `double`s or `long double`s begin at particular addresses.

    **Exception**: Low level routines that are expressly written for the purpose of data formatting (e.g. marshalling data, endian conversions, etc.) are permitted.

## Change log

* [2016-06-27] - the CamelCase convention was replaced to all lowercase names, including for class names. A temporary version with class names starting with upper case was tested, but finally was dismissed.
* [2016-06-27] - C style comments are accepted (even recommended) for Doxygen comments.
