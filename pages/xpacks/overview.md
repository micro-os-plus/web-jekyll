## Overview

The [xPacks](https://xpack.github.io)
project provides the automation to run multi-platform tests
and to manage dependencies to source libraries and to binary tools.

XCDL is a component framework inspired from
[eCOS CDL](http://ecos.sourceware.org/ecos/docs-latest/cdl-guide/language.html).
It includes a set of metadata definitions and tools to manage the
configuration step of a project.

XCDL is currently work in progress,
and is planned to be included in ÂµOS++ IVe.
