## Overview

**CMSIS++**, or rather **POSIX++**, is a POSIX-like, portable, vendor-independent, hardware abstraction layer intended for **C++/C embedded applications**, designed with special consideration for the industry standard **ARM Cortex-M** processor series. Originally intended as a proposal for the next generation CMSIS,  **CMSIS++** can probably be more accurately defined as _"C++ CMSIS"_, and **POSIX++** as _"C++ POSIX"_.

## CMSIS++ RTOS: APIs vs reference implementations

The CMSIS++ cornerstone is the RTOS, and in this respect CMSIS++ RTOS can be analysed from two perspectives: the **CMSIS++ RTOS APIs**, with a modern design and the **CMSIS++ RTOS reference implementation** with a clean and efficient code.

In the first phase of the project, the CMSIS++ RTOS APIs were designed, with POSIX threads in mind, but from a C++ point of view.

The native CMSIS++ RTOS interface is the C++ API, with a C API implemented as a wrapper, and an ISO C++ Threads API implemented also on top of the native C++ API.

## The CMSIS++ RTOS C++ API as a wrapper on top of an existing RTOS

Initially, the C++ API was validated by implementing it as a wrapper on top of the popular open source project FreeRTOS. Full functionality was achieved, and the entire system passed the ARM CMSIS RTOS validation suite.

## The CMSIS++ RTOS reference synchronisation objects (semaphores, queues, etc)

With the native C++ API validated, while still using the safety net provided by an existing scheduler, the next step toward a grand design was to implement, in a portable way, the synchronisation objects defined by the CMSIS++ RTOS.

The result was a highly portable implementation, that requires a very simple interaction with the scheduler, basically a thread `suspend()` and `resume()`.

Using this model, all RTOS objects were implemented (semaphores, mutexes, condition variables, message queues, memory pools, event flags, clocks and timers); full functionality was achieved, and again the entire system passed the ARM CMSIS RTOS validation suite.

To be noted that in this configuration, when running on top of an existing RTOS, it is perfectly possible to select which implementation to use, at individual object level; in other words it is perfectly possible to run with some objects implemented by the host RTOS and some objects using the reference portable implementation. This is generally useful when some of the objects defined by CMSIS++ are not available in the host RTOS; for example in the current version of FreeRTOS there were no memory pools or condition variables, and these objects were supplied by the reference implementation.

## The CMSIS++ RTOS reference scheduler

The last piece to complete the puzzle was the scheduler. The CMSIS++ RTOS specifications do not mandate for a specific scheduling policy, and, when running on top of an existing RTOS, any scheduling policy can be used.

However, the CMSIS++ RTOS reference scheduler takes the beaten path and implements a priority based, round robin, cooperative and optionally preemptive scheduler.

In other words, threads are assigned priorities, higher priority threads are scheduled first, equal priority threads are scheduled in a round robin way, and scheduling points are entered either explicitly at any wait() or yield(), or are optionally triggered by periodic interrupts, like the system clock ticks, or by user interrupts.

### The scheduler portable code

The scheduler was designed to be as portable as possible, and to run on any reasonable architecture, with any word size.

As such, the scheduler's main responsibility is to manage the list of threads ready for execution and to switch their execution contexts in an orderly manner.

Although not mandatory for its functionality, the scheduler also keeps track of all registered threads, and provides iterators to walk these lists.

For a better modularity, the scheduler itself does not keep track of threads waiting for various events; this is delegated to the various synchronisation objects, that are expected to implement their own policy of suspending and resuming execution of threads waiting for common resources.

However, the reference synchronisation objects use similar lists to keep track of the waiting threads, and, to simplify the implementation, the scheduler provides base classes for these lists.

### The scheduler port-specific code

Regardless how carefully a portable scheduler is designed and implemented, there will always be a last mile where the platform differences become important.

To accommodate for these differences, the scheduler needs to be _ported_ on a specific platform. The _port_ includes the specific definitions, mainly the way of creating and switching thread contexts, but also handling interrupts, accessing timers and clocks, etc.

There are currently two such CMSIS++ RTOS scheduler ports available and fully functional:

- a 32-bits ARM thumb port, running on Cortex-M devices;
- a 64-bits synthetic POSIX port, running as a user process on **macOS** and **GNU/Linux**.

These ports are actually not part of the CMSIS++ package itself, which is highly portable, but are part of separate **µOS++** packages.

## The Cortex-M scheduler port

This 32-bits ARM thumb port is specifically designed to run on Cortex-M devices. It currently supports ARMv6-M and ARMv7-M architectures, with or without FPU. Support for ARMv8-M will be added when needed.

The implementation uses the ARM specific features, like PendSV, which greatly simplify things.

For example, the context switching is performed by a rather simple function:

```
void
__attribute__ ((section(".after_vectors"), naked, used, optimize("s")))
PendSV_Handler (void)
{
  // The naked attribute and the push/pop are used to fully control
  // the function entry/exit code; be sure other registers are not
  // used in the assembly parts.
  asm volatile ("push {lr}");

  // The whole mystery of context switching, in one sentence. :-)
  port::scheduler::restore_from_stack (
      port::scheduler::switch_stacks (
          port::scheduler::save_on_stack ()));

  asm volatile ("pop {pc}");
}
```

Apart from saving/returning, this function does exactly what it is expected to do:

- `save_on_stack ()` - saves the context of the current thread on the thread stack and returns the stack address;
- `switch_stacks ()` - saves the above stack address in the current thread control block, selects the next thread waiting to run and returns the address of its stack context;
- `restore_from_stack ()` - restores the context of the new thread from the stack.

The two save/restore functions are among the very few in the Cortex-M port that require assembly code:

```
inline stack::element_t*
__attribute__((always_inline))
save_on_stack (void)
{
  register stack::element_t* sp_;

  asm volatile
  (
      // Get the thread stack
      " mrs %[r], PSP                       \n"
      " isb                                 \n"

#if defined (__VFP_FP__) && !defined (__SOFTFP__)

      // Is the thread using the FPU context?
      " tst lr, #0x10                       \n"
      " it eq                               \n"
      // If so, push high vfp registers.
      " vstmdbeq %[r]!, {s16-s31}           \n"
      // Save the core registers r4-r11,r14.
      // Also save EXC_RETURN to be able to test
      // again this condition in the restore sequence.
      " stmdb %[r]!, {r4-r9,sl,fp,lr}       \n"

#else

      // Save the core registers r4-r11.
      " stmdb %[r]!, {r4-r9,sl,fp}          \n"

#endif
      : [r] "=r" (sp_) /* out */
      : /* in */
      : /* clobber. DO NOT add anything here! */
  );

  return sp_;
}

inline void
__attribute__((always_inline))
restore_from_stack (stack::element_t* sp)
{
  // Without enforcing optimisations, an intermediate variable
  // would be needed to avoid using R4, which collides with
  // the R4 in the list of ldmia.

  // register stack::element_t* sp_ asm ("r0") = sp;

  asm volatile
  (

#if defined (__VFP_FP__) && !defined (__SOFTFP__)

      // Pop the core registers r4-r11,r14.
      // R14 contains the EXC_RETURN value
      // and is restored for the next test.
      " ldmia %[r]!, {r4-r9,sl,fp,lr}       \n"
      // Is the thread using the FPU context?
      " tst lr, #0x10                       \n"
      " it eq                               \n"
      // If so, pop the high vfp registers too.
      " vldmiaeq %[r]!, {s16-s31}           \n"

#else

      // Pop the core registers r4-r11.
      " ldmia %[r]!, {r4-r9,sl,fp}          \n"

#endif

      // Restore the thread stack register.
      " msr PSP, %[r]                       \n"
      " isb                                 \n"

      : /* out */
      : [r] "r" (sp) /* in */
      : /* clobber. DO NOT add anything here! */
  );
}
```

The generated code (for Cortex-M3) is remarkably neat and tidy:

```
08000198 <PendSV_Handler>:
 8000198:	b500      	push	{lr}
 800019a:	f3ef 8009 	mrs	r0, PSP
 800019e:	f3bf 8f6f 	isb	sy
 80001a2:	e920 0ff0 	stmdb	r0!, {r4, r5, r6, r7, r8, r9, sl, fp}
 80001a6:	f000 fe07 	bl	8000db8 <os::rtos::port::scheduler::switch_stacks(unsigned long*)>
 80001aa:	e8b0 0ff0 	ldmia.w	r0!, {r4, r5, r6, r7, r8, r9, sl, fp}
 80001ae:	f380 8809 	msr	PSP, r0
 80001b2:	f3bf 8f6f 	isb	sy
 80001b6:	bd00      	pop	{pc}

```

## Static vs dynamic memory allocation

One of the initial CMSIS++ RTOS design requirements was to give the user full control over the memory allocation.

The implementation fulfilled this requirement, allowing any possible memory allocation scheme, from the simplicity of using fully static allocation to the extreme of using separate custom allocators for each object requiring dynamic memory.

The objects requiring dynamic memory are:

- threads, for the stacks
- message queues, for the queues (arrays of messages)
- memory pools, for the pools (arrays of blocks)

All these objects have a last `allocator` parameter in their constructors that defaults to the system allocator `memory::allocator<T>`.

For example one of the thread constructors is:

```
using Allocator = memory::allocator<stack::allocation_element_t>;

thread (const char* name, func_t function, func_args_t args,
        const attributes& attr = initializer, const Allocator& allocator =
              Allocator ());
```

By default the `memory::allocator<T>` is defined as:

```
template<typename T>
  using allocator = new_delete_allocator<T>;
```

but the user can define it as any standard C++ allocator, and so the behaviour of all objects requiring dynamic memory can be customised at once.

Even more, each such object has a separate template version, that takes a last allocator parameter, so at the limit each such object can be allocated using a separate allocator.

Given the magic of C++, using such allocators is straightforward:

```
template<typename T>
  class my_allocator;

thread_allocated<my_allocator> thread { "th", func, nullptr };

message_queue_allocated<my_allocator> queue1 { "q1", 7, sizeof(msg_t) };
message_queue_typed<msg_t, my_allocator> queue2 { "q2", 7 };

memory_pool_allocated<my_allocator> pool1 { "p1", 7, sizeof(blk_t) };
memory_pool_typed<blk_t, my_allocator> pool2 { "p2", 7 };
```

Static allocation is handled using exactly the same method, but different templates:

```
thread_static<2500> thread { "th", func, nullptr };

message_queue_static<7, msg_t> queue { "q" };

memory_pool_static<7, blk_t> pool { "p" };
```

## Tests

Writing RTOS unit tests was always tricky and the results debatable. This does not mean it should not be attempted; actually, if done properly, these tests can be very useful.

To improve testability, the synthetic POSIX platform was implemented. It allows to run most RTOS tests within a very convenient environment like macOS or GNU/Linux.

Another greatly helpful tool used to run the RTOS tests is the GNU ARM Eclipse QEMU, which emulates the STM32F4DISCOVERY board well enough for most tests to be relevant.

Actually most of the times the tests were performed either on macOS or on QEMU, and only rarely, usually at the end, as a final validation, the tests were also performed on physical hardware.

### The ARM CMSIS RTOS validation suite

The main test was the ARM CMSIS RTOS validation suite, that exercises quite thoroughly the interface published in the `cmsis_os.h` file.

This test is automatically performed by the test scripts on the STM32F4DISCOVERY board running under GNU ARM Eclipse QEMU and on the synthetic POSIX platform.

The result of a run is:

### The mutex stress test

This test exercises the scheduler and the thread synchronisation primitives. It creates 10 threads that compete for a mutex, simulate random activities and compute statistics on how many times each thread acquired the mutex, to validate the fairness of the scheduler.

The test is automatically performed by the scripts on the STM32F4DISCOVERY board running under GNU ARM Eclipse QEMU and on the synthetic POSIX platform.

A typical result of the run is:

```

### The semaphore stress test

This test exercises the synchronisation primitives available from interrupt service routines and the effectiveness of the critical sections. It creates a high frequency hardware timer which posts to a semaphore, and a thread counts if the posts arrived in time or were late, in other words if the scheduler was or not able to wakeup the thread fast enough.

The test runs on the physical STM32F4DISCOVERY board.

A typical result of the run shows that on this platform the scheduler can stand about 250.000 context switches per second:

## Conclusions

CMSIS++ is still a young project, and many things need to be addressed, but the core component, the RTOS, is pretty well defined and functional.

For now it may not be perfect (as it tries to be), but it definitely provides a more standard set of primitives, closer to POSIX, and a wider set of APIs, covering both C++ and C applications than many other existing RTOSes; at the same time it does its best to preserve compatibility with the original ARM CMSIS APIs.

Any contributions to improve CMSIS++ will be highly appreciated.
