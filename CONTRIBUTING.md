## Post your findings & questions

## Improve the pages

Most of the pages can be directly edited using the **Improve this page** link. This link identifies the markdown source of the page on GitHub, and opens the GitHub editor on it.

### Fork the Git

For this mechanism to work, you need to login to GitHub and to have the `micro-os-plus/micro-os-plus.github.io-source` project forked in your account.

After saving the changes, create a pull request.

## Submit bug reports & enhancement requests

If you discovered a typo, a broken link, or you have a pertinent suggestion how to enhance the µOS++ web site, please use the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/micro-os-plus/micro-os-plus.github.io-source/issues) tracker.

Be sure you report only issues related to the µOS++ web site. **DO NOT** use this tracker for functional issues related to µOS++.

To be allowed to enter issues, you need to first login to GitHub.

Note: the text should respect the markdown syntax; preview the message before posting and correct if it does not look as  expected, especially inline code or other quoted text.
